Primary Key
A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table. Primary keys must contain unique values. A primary key column cannot have NULL values.
A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of single or multiple fields. When multiple fields are used as a primary key, they are called a composite key.
If a table has a primary key defined on any field(s), then you can not have two records having the same value of that field(s).

Foreign Key
The tables are related to one another using "foreign keys". A foreign key is simply the primary key in a different table. The relationship between 2 tables matches the Primary Key in one of the tables with a Foreign Key in the second table. It is sometimes called "a referencing key". Diagrammatically, a foreign key is depicted as a line with an arrow at one end.
