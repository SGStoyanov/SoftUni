The relational model for database management is the most popular type of database models. Currently, it is approximately used by 90% of the database systems. It was formulated and proposed in 1969 by Edgar F. Codd.
The purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries.
A relational DBMS is special system software that is used to manage the organization, storage, access, security and integrity of data.  This specialized software allows application systems to focus on the user interface, data validation and screen navigation.  When there is a need to add, modify, delete or display data, the application system simply makes a "call" to the RDBMS.
